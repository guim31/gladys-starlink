# Starlink

Your Starlink dish in Gladys: its state, latency, packet loss, throughput, obstruction, alerts and snow
melt mode, read on your local network like the Starlink app does. Scene triggers tell when the
connection drops and comes back, and a dashboard widget shows the dish at a glance.

## Overview

- **One device per dish**, named after its hardware (e.g. "Starlink rev3"), identified by the dish's own
  serial: it survives an address change.
- **Local only**: the dish answers on `192.168.100.1:9200` (gRPC, the protocol of the Starlink app), without
  account, password or cloud.
- **Measures averaged over the refresh interval**: latency, packet loss and throughput come from the
  second-by-second history of the dish, not from a single sample.
- **Self-refreshing**: the integration reads the dish on its own timer; it does not depend on Gladys polling
  the device.
- **Safe by default**: rebooting or stowing the dish cuts the Internet, so these commands stay refused until
  you allow them.

## Prerequisites

- Gladys Assistant **5.1.0** or later (scene triggers, scene actions and widgets).
- A Starlink dish (standard, Gen 2 "rectangular", Gen 3, Mini…) powered on.
- **Gladys must reach `192.168.100.1`**. The integration runs in its own container on a Docker bridge
  network: its traffic goes out through the Gladys host, so it reaches the dish exactly when the Gladys host
  does.
  - With the **Starlink router**, it works as is: the router forwards `192.168.100.1` to the dish.
  - With **your own router** and the Starlink router in **bypass mode** (or a Starlink Ethernet adapter
    plugged into your router), most routers reach the dish address directly. If not, add on your router a
    static route to `192.168.100.1/32` through its WAN (Internet) interface.
  - Check from the Gladys host: `ping 192.168.100.1` must answer. The **Test the connection to the dish**
    button of the configuration confirms the integration sees it.

## Configuration

Open **Integrations → Starlink → Configuration**:

| Field                                    | Default         | Role                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dish address                             | `192.168.100.1` | IP address of the dish, optionally with the port (`9200` by default).                        |
| Refresh interval                         | 30 seconds      | 10, 15, 30 s or 1 min. The measures are averaged over this interval.                         |
| Language of the device texts             | Français        | Feature names (set when the dish is added) and the state text.                               |
| Allow the commands that cut the Internet | off             | Reboot, stow and deploy are refused until you enable it. The snow melt mode needs no opt-in. |

Then open **Integrations → Starlink → Discover** and add the dish to Gladys. The buttons of the
configuration screen:

- `test_connection` — **Test the connection to the dish**: says what answered (hardware, software, state).
- `reboot_dish` — **Reboot the dish**: the Internet comes back after a few minutes.
- `stow_dish` — **Stow the dish**: it folds flat (before a storm, to move it). No Internet until deployed.
- `unstow_dish` — **Deploy the dish**: it turns back to the sky and reconnects.

## The dish device

| Feature              | Type (Gladys) | Meaning                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Starlink online      | binary        | 1 when the dish is connected to the satellites, 0 otherwise (and when unreachable).     |
| State                | text          | Connected, Searching for satellites, Obstructed, Stowed, Sleeping, Unreachable…         |
| Latency              | duration (ms) | Mean ping time to the Starlink network over the interval (seconds fully lost excluded). |
| Packet loss          | percentage    | Share of lost pings over the interval.                                                  |
| Download / Upload    | rate (Mbit/s) | Mean traffic going through the dish over the interval — what you use, not a speed test. |
| Obstructed sky       | percentage    | Share of the sky the dish found obstructed (trees, buildings).                          |
| Obstructed right now | binary        | 1 while something blocks the dish at the moment of the reading.                         |
| Uptime               | duration (h)  | Time since the last reboot of the dish.                                                 |
| Power draw           | power (W)     | Mean power consumption over the interval (dishes that report it).                       |
| Heating (snow melt)  | binary        | 1 while the dish heats to melt snow.                                                    |
| Thermal throttling   | binary        | 1 while the dish limits itself because it is too hot.                                   |
| Overheating shutdown | binary        | 1 when the dish stopped because of overheating.                                         |
| Update pending       | binary        | 1 when a software update waits for a reboot.                                            |
| Snow melt mode       | selection     | Automatic, Always on, Off — can be changed from Gladys.                                 |
| Software version     | text          | The firmware of the dish.                                                               |

Only the values that change are sent to Gladys; an unchanged value is sent again every 6 hours so the
dashboard never says "no recent value".

### Snow melt mode

**Automatic** heats when the dish detects snow, **Always on** heats before a snowfall (more power),
**Off** never heats (saves power, but snow may cut the connection). Choose it from the device or with the
`set_snow_melt_mode` scene action.

## Widget

The `dish_status` widget (**Starlink**) shows the latency, the download and upload throughput, the
obstructed sky, then the state (green when connected, orange during an outage, red when unreachable), the
active alerts by name, the snow melt mode and the uptime. Once the dish is added to Gladys the tiles follow
its features live. Its optional setting picks the dish.

## Scene triggers

- `connection_lost` — **Starlink connection lost**: the dish has been offline for a whole refresh interval
  (two readings in a row), or stopped answering at all (cause `unreachable`: power cut, cable). Short drops
  are ignored. Filter on the **Cause** (obstructed, searching, stowed, sleeping, unreachable…). Variables:
  the cause code and the state text.
- `connection_restored` — **Starlink connection restored**: the dish is back after a reported loss.
  Variables: the outage duration in seconds and the cause.
- `obstruction_detected` — **Starlink sky obstructed**: something started blocking the dish, at most once
  every 10 minutes. Variable: the obstructed share of the sky (%).

An outage already under way when Gladys starts is not reported (Gladys cannot tell when it started).

## Scene actions

- `reboot_dish` — **Reboot the Starlink dish**.
- `stow_dish` — **Stow the Starlink dish**.
- `unstow_dish` — **Deploy the Starlink dish**.
- `set_snow_melt_mode` — **Set the Starlink snow melt mode** (automatic, always on, off).

The first three cut the Internet: they fail (and the scene logs it) until **Allow the commands that cut the
Internet** is enabled. Keep in mind that Gladys Plus, remote access and cloud notifications go through that
same Internet access.

## Scene examples

- **Warn when Starlink drops**: trigger `connection_lost` with the cause "Dish not answering (power,
  cable)" → send a message on a local channel (or a notification later, when the connection is back).
- **Log the outages**: trigger `connection_restored` → send the message "Starlink back after
  `outage_seconds` s".
- **Snow is forecast**: weather condition "snow" in the evening → `set_snow_melt_mode` "Always on"; the next
  morning → "Automatic".
- **Watchdog**: trigger `connection_lost`, cause "No network answer" → wait 10 minutes → `reboot_dish` (with
  the commands allowed).

## Troubleshooting

- **"The dish does not answer"**: from the Gladys host, `ping 192.168.100.1`. No answer: see the
  prerequisites (bypass mode, static route). An answer but still failing: check the address and the port
  (`9200`) in the configuration.
- **No device in Discover**: the dish must have answered once; use **Test the connection to the dish**.
- **Values never change**: check that the dish was added to Gladys; then look at the logs with
  `LOG_LEVEL=debug` (each reading is logged at debug level).
- **Power draw stays empty**: some dishes or firmware do not report it.
- **Feature names in the wrong language**: they are fixed when the dish is added; change the language, then
  delete and re-add the device (its history is lost).

## Limits

- The dish API is **unofficial**: SpaceX can change it with a firmware update. The integration ignores what
  it does not know and keeps working with what it still finds.
- **One dish** per installation (the address of the configuration). The Starlink Wi-Fi router is not read.
- Download and upload are the **traffic** going through the dish, not the capacity of the link.
- No obstruction map, no GPS position, no sleep schedule (the Starlink app does it).
- The fastest refresh interval is 10 seconds: an outage shorter than one interval may not show.
- Two small requests per interval (status ≈ 1 KB, history ≈ 25 KB), on the local network only: no quota,
  no Internet traffic.
